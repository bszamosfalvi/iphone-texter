## Iphone Availability Texter

Wrote this script last year for a friend who resells iPhones. The script scrapes iPhone availability data from https://iphonechecker.herokuapp.com and uses Twilio to send a text to your phone if any iPhones you are looking for are available. I put it up on AWS and used a cron to execute the script every couple of minutes.

Currently working on the backend of an app that will scrape Apple.com directly for latest availability information.
